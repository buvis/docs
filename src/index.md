# Bob's Universal and Very Intelligent System
This is the documentation for my home Kubernetes clusters in a declarative state. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [clusters repository](https://github.com/buvis/clusters) and makes the changes to them based on the YAML manifests.

A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from the people that have shared their clusters over at the now-defunct k8s-at-home community.

Another important component of BUVIS as a system are my [dotfiles, scripts and other artifacts](https://github.com/tbouska/buvis).
